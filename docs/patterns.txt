This document shows how I came up with the equation to calculate the centers of the triangles in the maze. However it is hard to understand this without a diagram.When I came up with this equation I reffered to the maze example.png a lot to see the pattern

for even x the y position is:

row   length  difference
0 -   0a -    0
1 -   1a -    0
2 -   3a -    1
3 -   4a -    1
4 -   6a -    2
5 -   7a -    2
6 -   9a -    3
7 -   10a -   3
8 -   12a -   4
9 -   13a -   4

where a is a constant "height" of the triangle. To be exact - the distance between the closest centers of triangles.

the pattern I noticed is that the difference of row with the distances multiplied by two gives back the index(row number), I can use that to simplify my code when finding positions of each point.

therefore to find how many times to add the a value I can use this equation:

	yd = i*a + (i-i%2)/2*a

where yd is the vertical distance, a is the constant calculated from the side length of the triangle and i is the index.

the i-i%2 part ensures that the number is even, but I can take advantage of java's arithmetic and simply i/2 will cut off any decimals

so then my equation is:

	yd = i*a + i/2*a;

further simplifying:

	yd = (i+i/2)*a;

so for example if i plug in row 7 I expect to get 10a from the chart above

plugging 7 into the equation:

yd = (7+7/2)*a
   = (7+3)*a
   = 10a




for odd x and y col, position is:

row  length difference
0 -  0a -   0
1 -  2a -   1
2 -  3a -   1
3 -  5a -   2
4 -  6a -   2
5 -  8a -   3
6 -  9a -   3
7 -  11a -  4
8 -  12a -  4
9 -  14a -  5

here the pattern is shifted down by one because of the nature of how the triangles are arranged. This means the pattern is the same as the one above but I have to add 1 to the difference to get the index value.

so the equation for odd column is(skipping all the steps to derive it):

	yd = (i+(i+1)/2)*a + 3^-2/2*a;

simplified

	yd = (i+(i+1)/2 + (3^-2/2))*a;

where (3^-2/2) is a constant distance that the center is shifted down in odd columns
	

so now having 2 equations I want to combine them into one.

	1. yd = (i+i/2)*a;

	2. yd = (i+(i+1)/2 + (3^-2/2))*a;
	
so here is my new equation which will work for any position in my triangular grid

	yd = {yi + [yi+(xi%2)]/2 + (3^-2/2)}*a;
