# TriangularMazeGenerator; 
grade 12 project - maze generator; 
The goal of this program is to generate mazes and then recursively solve them. The original project was to make a maze on a grid, but to make it more interesting I decided to make triangular maze generator/solver. This introduced some interesting problems which were rewarding to solve.

If you would like to try out the program i've included an executable jar file which you can run (given you have java installed)
